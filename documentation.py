    no_planet="Based on the characteristics observed in the light curve, this signal is unlikely to be from an exoplanet. The transit shape appears sharp and V-shaped rather than flat-bottomed, which usually indicates a stellar eclipse rather than a planetary transit. The depth of the dip is also irregular compared to what would be expected from a planet, suggesting the object blocking the star is too large to be planetary in size. In addition, the odd-even transit depths show noticeable differences and the light curve displays additional brightness variations outside the main dip, both of which are typical features of an eclipsing binary system rather than a stable planetary orbit. Taken together, these indicators strongly point to the source being a stellar companion or another non-planetary phenomenon rather than a genuine exoplanet."

The depth of the transit falls within a realistic planetary range, suggesting that the object blocking the star is roughly planet-sized rather than stellar. There’s no noticeable secondary eclipse or irregular brightness variation outside the transit, and the odd and even events match closely, which further supports the idea that a single object is orbiting the star. While follow-up observations are still needed to confirm it, the evidence here aligns well with what you’d expect from a real exoplanet."

The transit signal is periodic, stable, and consistent across every cycle, and the geometry of the dip is a clean, flat-bottomed U-shape that matches the signature of a solid body crossing a stellar disk. The transit depth and duration fall squarely within the known physical range for planets, not stars, and there’s no secondary eclipse, ellipsoidal variation, or odd-even depth difference—features that would hint at a binary system. Every diagnostic test aligns with the expected behavior of a planet-sized object in orbit around its host star. With all the evidence pointing the same way, this light curve represents a confirmed exoplanet rather than a false positive or stellar contaminant."

This project explores the application of a Random Forest classifier to analyze stellar light curves for exoplanet detection. By aggregating the decisions of multiple decision trees, Random Forests can model complex, non-linear relationships in the extracted light-curve features and are robust to noise and overfitting compared to individual tree-based or purely statistical models. We develop and evaluate a Random Forest model trained on labeled light curve datasets from the Kepler mission, comparing its performance against established methods. Our results demonstrate improvements in detection accuracy, precision, and recall, highlighting the potential of ensemble learning in advancing exoplanet discovery.

The idea is to create a machine learning model that can predict if an observation is a real candidate for an exoplanet or not.

prop_1='''
        The proposed system aims to automate the detection of exoplanet transits from stellar light curves using a Random Forest Classifier. Random Forest is an ensemble-based supervised learning algorithm that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the majority class as the final prediction. Its ability to handle high-dimensional data, reduce overfitting, and maintain interpretability makes it well-suited for this application.\n
The system will utilize Kepler mission light curve datasets, which contain flux measurements recorded over time for thousands of stars. The data will undergo preprocessing steps such as noise reduction, normalization, feature extraction, and outlier removal. Key statistical and temporal features — such as flux variance, skewness, periodogram power, and transit depth — will be derived to represent each light curve in a structured format suitable for machine learning.'''

prop_2='''
The overall workflow of the proposed system includes the following steps:

Data Collection: Acquire light curve data from the Kepler exoplanet archive.\n
Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the flux data to remove trends, gaps, and noise.\n
Feature Extraction: Compute time-series and statistical features that capture brightness variation and periodicity.\n
Model Training: Train the Random Forest Classifier on labeled data (planet vs. non-planet). Each tree in the forest learns different feature combinations, enhancing generalization.\n
Prediction and Evaluation: Classify unseen light curves and evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.\n
This system provides a reliable and computationally efficient method for detecting exoplanet transits without requiring deep learning architectures. By leveraging the ensemble power of Random Forests, the model can handle noise, reduce bias, and achieve strong predictive accuracy even on complex astronomical data. Ultimately, this approach enhances the automation and reliability of exoplanet detection in large-scale datasets.'''
